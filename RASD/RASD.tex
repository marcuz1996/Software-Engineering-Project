domain	model	(class	diagrams	and	statecharts)}

\section{FORMAL	ANALYSIS	USING	ALLOY: This	section	should include	a	brief	presentation	of the	
main	objectives	driving	the	formal	modeling	activity, as	well	as	a	description	of the	model	
itself,	what	can	be	proved with	it, and	why	what	is	proved is	important	given	the	problem	at	
hand. To	show	 the	soundness	and	correctness	of	the model,	 this	section	can	show	some
worlds	obtained	by	running	it,	and/or	the	results	of	the	checks	performed	on	meaningful	
assertions}
\section{EFFORT	SPENT: In	this	section	you	will	include	information	about	the	number	of	hours	each	
group	member	has	worked	for	this	document.}
